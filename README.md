# CRUD_sample
This is a basic example of a CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) system using NodeJS and SQLITE, including JWT authentication.
It is still incomplete.

## Installation
Having Node and NPM installed, all you gotta do after cloning the repository is navigate to it's directory and run

```bash
npm install
```
to install the dependencies. The SQLITE file and the .env are already included.

## Usage
To start the server, run
```bash
node server.js
```
then, access localhost:3003 on a browser; The login page must appear.
You can test it with user "admin" and password "123456".

## Upcoming
In the following weeks I will be further upgrading this code.
